## What is BMad-CORE?

### The Problem with Traditional AI

Traditional AI tools provide **average, bland solutions** and do the thinking **for** you, making you dependent rather than capable.

### The BMad-CORE Difference

BMad-CORE brings out **the best thinking in you and the AI** through:

- **Guided Collaboration**: AI agents act as expert coaches, mentors, and collaborators
- **Reflective Workflows**: Structured frameworks that help you discover insights
- **Strategic Questioning**: Agents ask the right questions to stimulate your thinking
- **Domain Mastery**: Build expertise rather than just getting answers
- **Amplified Abilities**: Your natural talents enhanced, not replaced

### The C.O.R.E. System

- **C**ollaboration: Human-AI partnership where both contribute unique strengths
- **O**ptimized: Refined processes for maximum effectiveness
- **R**eflection: Guided thinking that unlocks better solutions
- **E**ngine: Powerful framework orchestrating specialized agents and workflows

---

## üéâ What's New in v6 Alpha

### Complete Ground-Up Rewrite

Everything rebuilt with best practices, advanced prompt engineering, and standardized XML/markdown conventions for maximum agent adherence.

### üé® Unprecedented Customizability

- **Agent Customization**: Modify any agent via sidecar files in `bmad/_cfg/agents/`
- **Update-Safe**: Your customizations persist through updates
- **Full Control**: Change names, personas, communication styles, language
- **Multi-Language**: Agents can communicate in your preferred language

### üöÄ Intelligent Installer

Brand new interactive installer that configures:

- Your name (how agents address you)
- Communication language preference
- Communication (chat) technical level of explanation (beginner - advanced level technical user knowledge)
- Documentation output language
- Module-specific customization options
- IDE-specific enhancements globally or per module (e.g., Claude Code sub-agents for BMM)

### üìÅ Unified Installation

Everything installs to a single `bmad/` folder - no more scattered root folders. Clean, organized, and efficient.

### ü§ù Consolidated Agent Party

When you install modules, a unified agent party is created for party-mode in your IDE. Super efficient agent simulation with more exciting features coming in beta!

### üéÆ Expanded Game Development

Game development now fully integrated into BMM module:

- **Game Type Adaptive**: Adjusts to the type of game you're making
- **Multi-Engine Support**: More platforms being added

### ‚ö° BMM Scale Adaptive Workflows

The BMad Method now adapts to your project scale (Levels 0-4) based on:

- Project scope and complexity
- New vs. existing codebase
- Current codebase state
- Team size and structure

Guides workflows intelligently from simple tech specs to enterprise-scale planning.

### üÜï Three Agent Types (BMB)

1. **Full Module Agents**: Complete agents embedded in modules
2. **Hybrid Agents**: Shared across modules
3. **Standalone Agents**: Tiny, specialized agents free from any module - perfect for specific needs

---

## BMad Method (BMM) Four-Phase Workflow

The BMM module follows a comprehensive four-phase methodology. Each phase adapts to your project's scale and complexity.

**[Complete workflow documentation ‚Üí](./src/modules/bmm/workflows/README.md)**

### Phase 1: Analysis _(Optional)_

**Analyst Agent**:

- `brainstorm-project` - Generate and refine project concepts
- `research` - Market research, deep research, prompt generation
- `product-brief` - Document initial product vision

**Game Designer Agent** _(for game projects)_:

- `brainstorm-game` - Game-specific ideation
- `game-brief` - Game concept documentation
- `research` - Game market and technical research

---

### Phase 2: Planning _(Required)_

**PM Agent**:

- `plan-project` - Creates scale-adaptive PRD or GDD

The planning workflow adapts to:

- Project complexity (Levels 0-4)
- Project type (web, mobile, embedded, game, etc.)
- New vs. existing codebase
- Team structure

**Game Designer Agent** _(for game projects)_:

- `plan-game` - Uses same workflow but optimized for Game Design Documents

---

### Phase 3: Solutioning _(Levels 3-4)_

**Architect / Game Architect Agent**:

- `architecture` - Creates adaptive architecture based on project type
  - No more document sharding
  - Adapts sections to your project (web, mobile, embedded, game, etc.)
  - Beyond basic concerns (complex testing, DevOps, security), specialized agents assist _(coming soon)_

- `tech-spec` - Generates Epic Tech Specs
  - Pulls all technical information from planning
  - Includes web research as needed
  - One tech spec per epic
  - Enhances SM's ability to prepare stories

**Note**: The PO can validate epics/stories with checklists, though the Architect maintains them during solutioning.

---

### Phase 4: Implementation _(Iterative)_

**Scrum Master (SM) Agent**:

Before development starts, the SM prepares each story:

1. `create-story` - Generates story from tech spec and context
2. `story-context` - **üéâ NEW!** Game-changing contextual preparation
   - Real-time context gathering for the specific story
   - No more generic file lists
   - Supercharged, specialized development context

**Dev Agent**:

Enhanced developer workflow:

- Development task execution
- Senior dev agent review (replaces separate QA agent)
- Pulls rich context from story-context workflow

**üéä Many more exciting changes throughout BMM for you to discover during alpha!**

## Detailed Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v20+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- **Git** (for cloning)

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

**Option A** - One-line install:

```bash
git clone --branch v6-alpha --single-branch https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD
```

**Option B** - Standard clone then checkout:

```bash
# Clone via your preferred method:
gh repo clone bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD
# OR
git clone https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD.git
# OR
git clone git@github.com:bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD.git

# Change to the directory
cd BMAD-METHOD

# Checkout alpha branch
git checkout v6-alpha

# Verify branch
git status
# Should show: "On branch v6-alpha. Your branch is up to date with 'origin/v6-alpha'."
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Verify `node_modules` folder exists at project root.

#### Step 3: Install to Your Project

```bash
npm run install:bmad
```

**Follow the interactive prompts:**

1. **Destination Path**: Enter the **full path** to your project folder
   - Don't accept the default
   - For new projects, confirm when prompted to create the directory
2. **Module Selection**:
   - **Core** (always installed)
   - **BMM** - BMad Method for software development (default)
   - **BMB** - BMad Builder for creating agents/workflows
   - **CIS** - Creative Intelligence Suite

3. **Configuration**:
   - Your name
   - Preferred communication language
   - Module-specific options

#### Step 4: Understanding the Installation

All modules install to a single `bmad/` folder in your project:

```
your-project/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bmad/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/         # Core framework (always present)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bmm/          # BMad Method (if selected)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bmb/          # BMad Builder (if selected)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cis/          # Creative Intelligence Suite (shared resources)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _cfg/         # Your customizations
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/   # Agent sidecar customization files
```

**Note**: You may see folders for modules you didn't explicitly select. This is intentional - modules share minimal required resources. For example, BMM uses CIS brainstorming workflows, so `bmad/cis/` appears with shared files even if you only selected BMM.
