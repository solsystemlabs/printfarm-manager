# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project:** printfarm-manager
**Analyst:** Taylor

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** Level 3 (Full Product)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg.md (Large project instruction set for Levels 3-4)

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** A web application to help 3D print farm owners manage their model files, sliced files of those models, and physical products that result from printing sliced files. Built on TanStack Start with Cloudflare Workers, focusing on automated metadata extraction from Bambu Lab `.gcode.3mf` files to create reproducible "recipe cards" that enable assistant autonomy and eliminate operational bottlenecks.
- **Estimated Stories:** 32 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 5 epics
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield - Adding to existing clean codebase
- **Existing Documentation:** Extensive - Product Brief, PRD, Epics, Solution Architecture, UX Specification, Tech Specs (Epic 1 & 2), Technical Decisions, and various supporting documents
- **Team Size:** Solo developer (Taylor)
- **Deployment Intent:** MVP for personal print farm operations with three environments (dev/staging/production), deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Future potential SaaS transformation after operational validation.

- Epic 2: `tech-spec-epic-2.md` (Core File Management)

### Workflow Sequence

**CURRENT STATE: Documentation Phase Complete**

The project has completed the full planning and architecture phase. Based on the existing documentation, the recommended next steps are:

1. ✅ **Assessment** - Complete
2. ✅ **Product Brief** - Complete
3. ✅ **PRD Generation** - Complete
4. ✅ **Epic Breakdown** - Complete
5. ✅ **Architecture Design** - Complete
6. ✅ **UX Specification** - Complete
7. ✅ **Tech Specs (Epics 1-2)** - Complete
8. ⏭️ **Implementation Phase** - Ready to begin

**You are ready to move from planning to implementation.**

### Next Actions

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Complete Remaining Tech Specs** (Optional but Recommended)
   - Epic 3: Metadata Extraction & Filament Matching
   - Epic 4: Product & Recipe System
   - Epic 5: Search & Discovery
   - These can be generated on-demand before each epic's implementation sprint

2. **Begin Sprint 0 (Epic 1 Implementation)**
   - Story 1.1: Configure Cloudflare Workers Environments
   - Story 1.2: Set Up Xata Database with Branching
   - Story 1.3: Configure Cloudflare R2 Buckets
   - Continue through Epic 1's 7 stories

3. **Development Setup Verification**
   - Ensure local development environment operational
   - Verify Cloudflare account and Wrangler CLI configured
   - Confirm Xata project created and accessible
   - Test R2 bucket access

4. **Implementation Tracking**
   - Consider using story tracking system (GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.)
   - Reference epics.md for detailed acceptance criteria
   - Follow sprint structure outlined in PRD

## Special Considerations

### Strengths of Current Documentation

- **Comprehensive Requirements**: All FRs and NFRs are well-defined with clear rationale
- **User-Centric Design**: User journeys and UX principles provide clear implementation guidance
- **Technical Detail**: Architecture and tech specs provide concrete implementation roadmap
- **Scope Discipline**: Clear MVP boundaries with Phase 2/3 features explicitly deferred

### Areas to Monitor During Implementation

1. **Metadata Extraction Complexity**
   - Bambu Lab format well-documented, but edge cases may emerge
   - Plan for iteration on Zod schema as metadata variations discovered

2. **Performance Targets**
   - 10-second extraction time, 1-second search, 30-second recipe retrieval
   - May require optimization iterations to hit consistently

3. **R2 File Handling**
   - Header configuration for forced downloads
   - Atomic operations for R2 + database consistency

4. **Xata Branching Integration**
   - PR preview branches with Cloudflare Workers Builds
   - Test thoroughly in Sprint 0

### Workflow Choice Rationale

**Why Level 3 (Full PRD + Architect Handoff)?**

- 32 stories across 5 epics clearly exceeds Level 1-2 thresholds
- Multiple interconnected systems (files, metadata, products, search)
- Complex data modeling with many-to-many relationships
- Three-environment deployment with CI/CD requirements
- 6-8 week timeline with 8 sprints justifies comprehensive planning

**The existing documentation perfectly matches Level 3 deliverables.**

## Technical Preferences Captured

### Confirmed Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 19 with automatic JSX runtime
- TanStack Router (file-based routing with SSR)
- TanStack Query (React Query for server state)
- TailwindCSS with tailwind-merge
- TypeScript (strict mode)

**Backend/Runtime:**
- TanStack Start (full-stack React framework)
- Cloudflare Workers (serverless edge runtime)
- Vite (build tool)

**Database:**
- Xata (managed PostgreSQL) for staging/production
- PostgreSQL (Docker) for local development
- Prisma ORM (type-safe database client)

**Storage:**
- Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible object storage)
- All files in R2, only metadata in database

**Development:**
- Vitest + React Testing Library
- ESLint v9 (flat config)
- Prettier
- Git version control

**Deployment:**
- Wrangler CLI
- Cloudflare Workers Builds (automated CI/CD)
- Three environments: dev (local), staging (master branch), production (production branch)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Product-Centric Data Model** - Physical products are first-class entities, files serve them
2. **Metadata Extraction as Core Value** - Automated extraction eliminates manual data entry
3. **AMS Slot Tracking** - Critical for assistant autonomy, non-negotiable requirement
4. **No Authentication in MVP** - Public access, defer auth to Phase 3
5. **Hard Delete in MVP** - Soft delete with restore deferred to Phase 2
6. **Bambu Lab Format Only** - Other slicer formats deferred to Phase 2

### Development Principles

- **Zero monetary cost** - Self-funded, leveraging free tiers
- **Solo development** - All work by Taylor
- **MVP discipline** - Resist feature creep, ship functional system
- **Real-world validation** - Validate through daily operational use
- **Type safety everywhere** - TypeScript strict mode, Zod validation
