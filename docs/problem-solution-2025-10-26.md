# Problem Solving Session: Staging Deployment Completely Down After Story 2.4 Merge

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Problem Solver:** Taylor
**Problem Category:** Production Incident / Deployment Failure

## üéØ PROBLEM DEFINITION

### Initial Problem Statement

Recent work on story 2.4 created a deployment that succeeds (build completes, Cloudflare accepts the deployment) but the application is completely non-functional in staging. All HTTP requests to any page/route on `pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com` result in HTTP 500 errors with minimal diagnostic information. The error logs show the Worker executes successfully (`"outcome": "ok"`) but returns generic "HTTPError" without stack traces or detailed error messages. The issue appeared immediately after deployment and affects all routes universally. Previous deployment works correctly.

### Refined Problem Statement

**Story 2.4 introduced code that attempts to access Cloudflare R2 bindings during application initialization or SSR, causing all page loads to fail with HTTP 500 errors in the staging environment.**

The key breaking change in commits `4b48158` and `118d2a8`:
- Added `vinxi` package dependency (v0.5.8)
- Modified storage client to use `getContext('cloudflare')` from `vinxi/http` to access `FILES_BUCKET` R2 binding
- Updated API routes (`upload.ts`, `import-zip.ts`, `test-r2.ts`) to call `getContext('cloudflare')` to retrieve the Cloudflare environment bindings
- R2 bucket binding (`FILES_BUCKET`) is properly configured in `wrangler.jsonc` for staging environment

**The gap**: Code is attempting to access Cloudflare context (via vinxi's `getContext`) at a point in the request lifecycle where it's either unavailable or causing an unhandled error, resulting in generic HTTP 500s without useful stack traces.

### Problem Context

**Environment Details:**
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Workers with TanStack Start framework
- **Affected Environment**: Staging (`pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com`)
- **Trigger**: Deployment of story 2.4 changes (commits `15157ae`, `4b48158`, `118d2a8`) to master branch
- **Scope**: Complete site failure - all pages and routes return 500 (including simple homepage with no storage calls)
- **Timing**: Immediate failure upon deployment - no gradual degradation

**Error Characteristics:**
- HTTP 500 status code on all requests
- Generic "HTTPError" message with no stack trace or detailed error information
- Very fast failure (3ms wall time) suggesting error occurs early in request lifecycle
- Worker outcome shows "ok" (worker executed successfully, but application code inside failed)
- No useful diagnostic information in Cloudflare logs

**Code Changes in Story 2.4:**
1. Added `vinxi` package (v0.5.8) to dependencies
2. Modified `src/lib/storage/client.ts` to use Cloudflare R2 via `getContext('cloudflare')`
3. Updated API routes to retrieve R2 binding:
   - `src/routes/api/models/upload.ts`
   - `src/routes/api/models/import-zip.ts`
   - `src/routes/api/test-r2.ts`
4. R2 bucket properly configured in `wrangler.jsonc` staging environment:
   ```json
   "r2_buckets": [{
     "binding": "FILES_BUCKET",
     "bucket_name": "pm-staging-files"
   }]
   ```

**Known Good State**:
- Previous deployment (commit `15157ae` - merge PR #13) works correctly when rolled back
- Development environment (localhost) likely works with MinIO
- Production environment status unknown (not yet deployed)

**Framework Context**:
- TanStack Start with SSR enabled
- Vinxi is the underlying build tool for TanStack Start
- `getContext('cloudflare')` is documented approach for accessing Cloudflare bindings in API routes
- However, accessing context during SSR or app initialization may not work the same way

### Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ **Immediate**: Staging environment loads successfully and returns expected pages (all routes functional)
2. ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Error properly diagnosed with clear understanding of why `getContext('cloudflare')` fails
3. ‚úÖ **Fix Implemented**: Solution deployed to staging and validated
4. ‚úÖ **Proper Error Handling**: If R2 access fails, application provides meaningful error messages instead of generic 500s
5. ‚úÖ **Prevention**: Understanding documented to prevent similar issues in future (e.g., "never call getContext during SSR" or "always wrap in try-catch with detailed logging")
6. ‚úÖ **Rollout Ready**: Confidence that fix won't break production when merged to production branch

## üîç DIAGNOSIS AND ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Problem Boundaries (Is/Is Not)

| Dimension | **IS** (Problem Occurs) | **IS NOT** (Problem Doesn't Occur) |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Where** | ‚Ä¢ Staging environment (`pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com`)<br>‚Ä¢ All routes and pages<br>‚Ä¢ Cloudflare Workers runtime | ‚Ä¢ Previous deployment (pre-story 2.4)<br>‚Ä¢ Local development (MinIO-based)<br>‚Ä¢ Build/deployment process itself |
| **When** | ‚Ä¢ Immediately on page load<br>‚Ä¢ All HTTP requests (GET /)<br>‚Ä¢ Very early in request lifecycle (~3ms)<br>‚Ä¢ After deploying vinxi + getContext changes | ‚Ä¢ During build process<br>‚Ä¢ During deployment upload<br>‚Ä¢ In rollback deployment |
| **What** | ‚Ä¢ HTTP 500 errors<br>‚Ä¢ Generic "HTTPError" message<br>‚Ä¢ No stack trace or details<br>‚Ä¢ Worker executes but app code fails<br>‚Ä¢ Even simple routes fail (homepage) | ‚Ä¢ Build failures<br>‚Ä¢ Deployment upload failures<br>‚Ä¢ R2 binding misconfiguration<br>‚Ä¢ Routes that existed before change<br>‚Ä¢ Storage business logic errors |
| **Who/Impact** | ‚Ä¢ All users accessing staging<br>‚Ä¢ All routes universally<br>‚Ä¢ Complete site unavailability | ‚Ä¢ Specific users or sessions<br>‚Ä¢ Specific routes only<br>‚Ä¢ Intermittent/gradual failures |

**Key Patterns Emerging:**

1. **Scope is Universal**: Every single route fails, even the simple homepage that doesn't touch storage code. This rules out storage business logic as the root cause.

2. **Timing is Immediate & Early**: 3ms failure time and immediate failure on first request suggests the error occurs during application bootstrap/initialization, not during route handling.

3. **Error Swallowing**: The lack of stack traces despite Worker "outcome: ok" suggests:
   - Error is caught somewhere and re-thrown generically
   - OR vinxi/TanStack Start has error handling that swallows details
   - OR the error occurs in a context where stack traces don't propagate

4. **Deployment vs Runtime**: Build and deployment succeed, but runtime fails. This points to:
   - Code that only executes in Cloudflare Workers runtime (not during build)
   - Something about how vinxi or the app initializes in Workers
   - Possibly module-level code execution (imports that run immediately)

5. **Environment-Specific**: Only breaks in staging (Cloudflare Workers), works in development. The common factor: environments that try to use `getContext('cloudflare')`.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Method Used**: Five Whys Root Cause Analysis

**Why #1**: Why do all routes (including the simple homepage) fail with HTTP 500?
- **Answer**: The application code fails during module loading/initialization, before any route handler executes.

**Why #2**: Why does the application fail during module loading?
- **Answer**: The build is trying to import `vinxi/http` module, which is marked as "external" in the build configuration.

**Why #3**: Why is `vinxi/http` being imported if it's marked as external?
- **Answer**: The API routes (`upload.ts`, `import-zip.ts`, `test-r2.ts`) import `getContext` from `vinxi/http` at the top of their files. Even though these specific routes aren't being accessed, TanStack Start likely loads/evaluates all route modules during application initialization.

**Why #4**: Why is `vinxi/http` marked as external in the build?
- **Answer**: In commit `4b48158`, the developer added this to `vite.config.ts`:
  ```typescript
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ["vinxi/http"],
    },
  },
  ```
  This tells Vite/Rollup "don't bundle this module, expect it to be available at runtime."

**Why #5**: Why was `vinxi/http` marked as external?
- **Answer**: Likely a misunderstanding of how to fix a build or import issue. The developer may have seen an error related to `vinxi/http` and incorrectly thought marking it as "external" would solve it. However, `vinxi/http` is part of the Vinxi framework (which TanStack Start uses) and should be **bundled**, not treated as an external runtime dependency.

**üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

The `vite.config.ts` file incorrectly marks `vinxi/http` as an external dependency (`external: ["vinxi/http"]`). This causes the build to exclude this module from the bundle, expecting it to be available in the Cloudflare Workers runtime. However, `vinxi/http` is not available in the Workers runtime‚Äîit must be bundled with the application code.

When the application tries to load in Cloudflare Workers, it attempts to import `vinxi/http` (used in API route files), fails to find it, throws an error during module initialization, and this error is caught and re-thrown as a generic "HTTPError" with no stack trace.

**The Fix**: Remove the `external: ["vinxi/http"]` configuration from `vite.config.ts` to allow Vite to properly bundle this module.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Poor Error Reporting**: TanStack Start/Vinxi's error handling swallows the actual error details and returns generic "HTTPError", making diagnosis difficult.

2. **Module-Level Side Effects**: All route modules are loaded during app initialization (likely for route tree generation), so an error in any module affects the entire application‚Äîeven routes that never execute.

3. **Build Succeeds Despite Runtime Issue**: The build process doesn't validate that external dependencies actually exist at runtime, so the deployment succeeds despite the fatal configuration error.

4. **Unclear Documentation**: The developer likely added the external configuration without understanding the implications. Better documentation or error messages about when to use `external` would prevent this.

5. **Missing Local Testing**: The issue only appears in Cloudflare Workers deployment, not in local development (which may handle module resolution differently).

### System Dynamics

**Feedback Loop #1 - Error Masking Cascade:**
```
Config error ‚Üí Build succeeds ‚Üí Deploy succeeds ‚Üí Runtime fails ‚Üí
Generic error ‚Üí Hard to debug ‚Üí Trial-and-error fixes ‚Üí More config errors
```

**Feedback Loop #2 - Module Loading Chain:**
```
App starts ‚Üí Loads route tree ‚Üí Imports all route modules ‚Üí
API routes import vinxi/http ‚Üí Module not found ‚Üí App crashes ‚Üí
All routes fail (even simple ones)
```

**System Dependencies:**
- **Vite Build System** ‚Üí Controls bundling and external dependencies
- **TanStack Start** ‚Üí Uses Vinxi framework, loads all routes at init
- **Vinxi Framework** ‚Üí Provides `vinxi/http` for context access
- **Cloudflare Workers** ‚Üí Runtime environment with limited module availability
- **Error Handling** ‚Üí Catches errors but loses detail in the process

**Leverage Point:**
The `vite.config.ts` file is the single point of control. One line changed ‚Üí entire system works again.

## üìä ANALYSIS

### Force Field Analysis

**Driving Forces (Supporting Solution):**

1. **üî¥ High Urgency** (Strength: Very Strong)
   - Staging is completely down‚Äî100% site failure
   - Blocking QA, testing, and development workflow
   - High motivation to fix immediately

2. **‚úÖ Clear Root Cause** (Strength: Very Strong)
   - Exactly identified the problematic config line
   - Understand why it fails and what the fix is
   - No ambiguity about what needs to change

3. **üõ†Ô∏è Simple Fix** (Strength: Strong)
   - Just remove 4 lines from `vite.config.ts`
   - No complex code changes required
   - Can deploy and test quickly

4. **üîÑ Safe Rollback Available** (Strength: Strong)
   - Previous deployment works correctly
   - Can revert if fix doesn't work
   - Low risk of making things worse

5. **üí° Learning Opportunity** (Strength: Moderate)
   - Understanding prevents future similar issues
   - Improves team knowledge of Vite/Vinxi internals
   - Can document for future reference

**Restraining Forces (Blocking Solution):**

1. **‚ùì Unknown Original Intent** (Strength: Moderate)
   - Don't know why `external: ["vinxi/http"]` was added
   - Might have been trying to fix another issue
   - Removing it could expose that original issue
   - **Mitigation**: Check git commit message and test thoroughly

2. **üîç Limited Error Visibility** (Strength: Moderate)
   - If something else breaks, we may get generic errors again
   - Cloudflare Workers logs don't show detailed stack traces
   - Makes it hard to debug new issues
   - **Mitigation**: Add better error logging before deploying

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Untested Fix** (Strength: Moderate)
   - Haven't verified that removing the config actually works
   - Haven't tested that file uploads still work afterward
   - **Mitigation**: Test locally first, then staging, then production

4. **‚è∞ Time Pressure** (Strength: Low-Moderate)
   - Pressure to fix quickly might skip important testing
   - Might miss edge cases or related issues
   - **Mitigation**: Follow structured testing plan despite urgency

### Constraint Identification

**Primary Constraint:**
- **Time to Resolution**: Staging is completely unusable‚Äîevery minute counts. This is the bottleneck limiting all other work.

**Other Constraints:**
1. **Cannot Break Existing Functionality**: Fix must not introduce new issues (especially for R2 file uploads that story 2.4 was implementing)
2. **Limited Testing Environment**: No separate testing environment between local dev and staging
3. **Must Work Across Environments**: Fix must work in both staging and production
4. **Poor Error Diagnostics**: If something breaks, debugging is difficult due to generic error messages

**Real vs Assumed Constraints:**
- ‚úÖ **Real**: Staging must be fixed urgently (blocking work)
- ‚úÖ **Real**: Must preserve R2 upload functionality (story 2.4's purpose)
- ‚ùì **Potentially Assumed**: That we need to keep vinxi package at v0.5.8 (might be able to upgrade/downgrade if needed)
- ‚ùì **Potentially Assumed**: That removing the external config is safe (need to verify why it was added)

### Key Insights

1. **Configuration Changes Have Cascading Effects**: A single line in a build config file can break an entire application in production-like environments, even though the build succeeds locally.

2. **The "External" Flag is Dangerous**: Marking modules as external should only be done for truly external runtime dependencies (like Node.js built-ins in some environments), not for bundled framework code.

3. **Module-Level Imports Create Hidden Dependencies**: Even though the homepage doesn't use storage, the fact that storage API routes import `vinxi/http` at the module level means *all* routes fail when that import fails.

4. **Error Handling Can Obscure Root Causes**: The generic "HTTPError" made diagnosis much harder. Better error handling that preserves stack traces would have immediately revealed the missing module issue.

5. **Local vs Production Environment Differences**: The problem only manifests in Cloudflare Workers, not local development, highlighting the importance of environment parity and testing in production-like environments.

6. **The Fix is Simple, But Understanding Matters**: While the fix is literally deleting 4 lines, understanding *why* those lines were added and *why* they broke things is crucial for preventing similar issues and ensuring the fix doesn't expose another problem.
