## Technology Stack Validation

### ✅ Technology and Library Decision Table

**Status**: PASS - All technologies have specific versions

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ All entries have specific versions or N/A (for platforms)
- ✅ No vague entries ("a logging library")
- ✅ No multi-option entries without decision
- ✅ Logically grouped (Frontend, Server, Build, Database, Deployment, Testing, etc.)
- ✅ Includes rationale column

**Sample Validations**:
- React: 19.0.0 ✅
- TanStack Router: ^1.132.33 ✅
- Zod: ^3.23.8 ✅
- Prisma: ^6.1.0 ✅
- JSZip: ^3.10.1 ✅
- sharp: ^0.33.5 ✅ (with verification note)

**Libraries to Add**: Clearly documented with npm install command
**Libraries to Remove**: redaxios explicitly identified

---

### ✅ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Status**: PASS - 5 ADRs documented

| ADR | Decision | Rationale Clarity | Consequences Documented |
|-----|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| ADR-001 | TanStack Start server functions over tRPC | ✅ Clear | ✅ Yes |
| ADR-002 | sharp for server-side image resizing | ✅ Clear | ✅ Yes (with verification required) |
| ADR-003 | Custom React Aria Components library | ✅ Clear | ✅ Yes |
| ADR-004 | Xata full-text search with ILIKE fallback | ✅ Clear | ✅ Yes |
| ADR-005 | Monorepo with file-based routing | ✅ Clear | ✅ Yes |

**Quality**: All ADRs follow consistent format (Status, Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences, Alternatives)

---

### ✅ Proposed Source Tree

**Status**: PASS - Complete and detailed

**Validation**:
- ✅ All directories explained with purpose comments
- ✅ Matches technology stack (TanStack Start file-based routing)
- ✅ Component organization clear (ui/, forms/, layout/, wizards/)
- ✅ API route structure matches endpoint design
- ✅ Lib organization by domain (db/, storage/, metadata/, filaments/, search/)
- ✅ Test structure included

**Depth**: Appropriate - shows 3-4 levels of nesting with key files

---

## Design vs Code Balance

### ✅ Design-Focused (Appropriate)

**Code Examples**:
- Prisma schema: ✅ Schema definition (not implementation)
- API endpoints: ✅ Request/response contracts (not handlers)
- Patterns: ✅ R2+DB atomic operation pattern (pseudocode)
- Zod schemas: ✅ Schema structure (not full validation logic)

**Longest Code Block**: ~50 lines (Prisma schema) - acceptable for schema definitions

**Assessment**: Appropriate design-level detail. No over-specification detected.

---

## Epic Alignment Matrix

### Epic-to-Component Mapping

| Epic | Primary Components | Data Models | API Routes | UI Components |
|------|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Epic 1: Infrastructure** | Environment Config, Observability, Database/R2 Setup | N/A (infrastructure) | N/A | EnvironmentIndicator, StorageDashboard |
| **Epic 2: File Storage** | Upload Service, Zip Processor, R2 Client, Thumbnail Service | Model, Slice | /api/models/*, /api/slices/upload | FileUpload, Grid, Card |
| **Epic 3: Metadata** | Metadata Parser, Validator, Filament Matcher | Filament, SliceFilament | /api/slices/extract-metadata, /api/filaments/match | SliceUploadWizard, MetadataViewer |
| **Epic 4: Products** | Product Service, Relationship Manager, Recipe Generator | Product, ProductVariant, SliceVariant, SliceModel | /api/products/*, /api/recipe/* | ProductCreationWizard, RecipeCard |
| **Epic 5: Search** | Search Service, Grid Renderer, Filter Engine | All entities (indexed) | /api/search | SearchBar, ProductGrid, Filters |

### Component Dependencies

```
Epic 1 (Infrastructure)
  ↓ provides runtime for
Epic 2 (File Storage)
  ↓ triggers
Epic 3 (Metadata Extraction)
  ↓ feeds into
Epic 4 (Product & Recipe System)
  ↓ indexed by
Epic 5 (Search & Discovery)
```

**Sequential Dependencies**: Epic 1 must complete before Epic 2
**Parallel Opportunities**: Epics 2-3 can be partially parallel (file upload independent of metadata)
**Integration Point**: Epic 4 integrates all prior epics

---

## Gaps and Notes

### Minor Notes (Non-Blocking)

1. **sharp Verification Required** (ADR-002)
   - **Issue**: sharp uses native bindings, may not work in Cloudflare Workers
   - **Mitigation**: Documented in Appendix with fallback options (wasm-vips, client-side canvas)
   - **Action**: Verify during Epic 2 Story 2.5 implementation
   - **Impact**: Low - fallback strategies identified

2. **Xata pg_trgm Extension** (ADR-004)
   - **Issue**: Levenshtein distance requires pg_trgm Postgres extension
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback to simple ILIKE queries documented
   - **Action**: Verify during Epic 5 Story 5.1 implementation
   - **Impact**: Low - basic search works without extension

3. **Specialist Sections** (Deferred)
   - **DevOps**: Simple inline (covered in Epic 1, no separate workflow needed)
   - **Security**: Simple inline (NFR-7 addressed, Phase 3 for auth)
   - **Testing**: Covered inline (Testing Strategy section, NFR-8 compliance)
   - **Decision**: No specialist placeholders required for MVP

### No Critical Gaps Detected ✅

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ **Generate Tech Specs** - All 5 epics ready for detailed tech spec generation
2. ✅ **Set Up Development Environment** - Install dependencies, configure Cloudflare resources
3. ⚠️ **Verify Technologies** - Test sharp and Xata pg_trgm during Epic 2/5 implementation

### Architecture Approval

✅ **Recommendation**: Approve architecture and proceed to implementation

**Rationale**:
- 100% requirements coverage (18 FRs, 12 NFRs)
- 100% epic coverage with clear component boundaries
- Technology stack fully specified with versions
- Appropriate design-level detail (no over-specification)
- Minor verification items documented with fallback strategies
- Epic dependencies clear and sequenced properly
