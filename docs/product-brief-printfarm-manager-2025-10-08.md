# Product Brief: printfarm-manager

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Author:** Taylor
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**PrintFarm Manager** is a web-based recipe repository that transforms 3D print farm operations from manual, owner-dependent chaos into systematic, reproducible manufacturing. It solves the critical problem of **inability to reliably reproduce products** that blocks business scaling.

**The Problem:** Running a print farm creates operational bottlenecks: reslicing files repeatedly, assistants unable to operate independently, missed production opportunities, and manual chaos that breaks under growth. Current solutions (folders, spreadsheets, generic tools) fail because they don't understand the relationships between models, slices, products, and filaments.

**The Solution:** Automatic metadata extraction from `.gcode.3mf` files eliminates manual data entry, creating permanent "recipes" for reproduction. Critical AMS slot tracking enables assistants to execute prints independently without asking "which filament goes where?" Product-centric architecture naturally supports business operations, not just hobby file storage.

**Target Market:** Initially personal use (print farm owner + assistants), with validated SaaS potential for other small print farms (1-20 printers) facing identical operational problems.

**Success Metrics:** 95% reduction in reslicing, 95% reduction in assistant questions, 100% autonomous reprints, ≤30-second recipe retrieval, ≤5-minute production cycle time.

**Strategic Value:** This is the **prerequisite for scaling the business**. Without it, growth is blocked. With it, the operation can add more products, maintain better inventory, and build customer base systematically. Break-even is immediate - items currently don't get printed due to operational friction; with the system, they generate revenue.

**Technical Approach:** TanStack Start + Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare R2 storage, Prisma ORM, solo development with zero monetary cost. MVP focuses on core automation (metadata extraction, smart filament matching, recipe cards), deferring inventory tracking, version history, and advanced features to Phase 2.

**Long-term Vision:** Prove system with personal use, refine based on daily operations, then investigate SaaS transformation for broader market once value is validated and market research confirms demand.

## Problem Statement

Running a 3D print farm business creates a critical operational bottleneck: **the inability to reliably reproduce products without constant manual intervention**.

### The Current Painful Reality

**Reslicing Waste:** Every time inventory runs low, the same models must be resliced from scratch because the original sliced files are lost in unorganized folders. This wastes hours per week on redundant work.

**Assistant Friction:** Without access to the original slice configuration, simple instructions become impossible. Questions like "which filament goes in which AMS slot?" require the owner to have direct access to sliced files - creating a dependency that blocks production when the owner is unavailable.

**Missed Production Opportunities:** Being out of office means lost print time. Remote decisions about what to print next are impossible without knowing which files exist, what settings were used, or which filaments are required.

**Manual Chaos at Scale:** As the business ramps up, the current approach (scattered files, mental tracking, constant re-work) becomes unsustainable. The system that worked for hobby printing breaks under business growth.

### Quantified Impact

- **Time Lost:** Single-digit hours weekly on reslicing, searching files, and answering assistant questions
- **Blocked Production:** Missed print opportunities whenever owner is unavailable
- **Quality Risk:** Inconsistent reproduction when relying on memory instead of documented recipes
- **Scaling Impossible:** Current workflow cannot support business growth without exponentially more overhead

### Why Existing Solutions Fail

**File systems (folders/drives):** No relationship tracking between models, slices, products, and filaments. Can't answer "what settings did I use for this?" or "which models make up this product?"

**Spreadsheets:** Too manual to maintain. Metadata gets out of sync with actual files immediately.

**Generic project management tools:** Not designed for manufacturing workflows. Don't understand the relationships between 3D models, gcode, filament configurations, and physical products.

### Why Now?

**Business is ramping up.** The print farm is transitioning from hobby to revenue-generating operation. Growth demands operational intelligence and systematic workflows that enable delegation and remote management. The current ad-hoc system is the bottleneck preventing scale.

---

## Proposed Solution

**PrintFarm Manager** is a web-based recipe repository that transforms 3D printing from ad-hoc file management into a systematic manufacturing operation. It treats print configurations as reproducible recipes - capturing the exact combination of models, filaments, and settings required to manufacture products consistently.

### Core Solution Approach

Instead of managing scattered files, the system creates **intelligent relationships** between four core entities:

- **Models** (source 3D files: STL, 3MF)
- **Slices** (gcode files with embedded configuration metadata)
- **Products** (physical items produced from slices)
- **Filaments** (materials with AMS slot assignments)

The breakthrough: **automatic metadata extraction from `.gcode.3mf` files** eliminates manual data entry. Upload a sliced file, and the system automatically extracts print settings, filament requirements, thumbnails, and configuration details - creating a permanent "recipe" for reproduction.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Metadata Extraction as Superpower**
Most systems treat gcode as opaque binary files. PrintFarm Manager parses `.gcode.3mf` metadata to auto-populate:
- Filament types and colors used
- Print settings (layer height, speed, temperature, etc.)
- Print time and material consumption
- Embedded thumbnails

**Result:** Zero manual data entry. The system becomes the single source of truth for "how we actually print things."

**2. AMS Slot Tracking (Critical for Delegation)**
Generic systems might track "uses Red PLA and Blue PETG" - which is useless for actual production. PrintFarm Manager captures **which AMS slot each filament occupies**:

- ❌ Generic: "Uses red, blue, yellow filaments"
- ✅ PrintFarm Manager: "Slot 1: Red PLA, Slot 2: Blue PLA, Slot 3: Yellow PETG"

**Result:** Assistants can execute prints independently without asking "which color goes where?"

**3. Product-Centric Architecture**
Files serve business outcomes. The data model centers on **products** (what customers buy), with models and slices as the recipes that produce them. This naturally supports inventory tracking, pricing, and scaling to business operations - not just hobby file storage.

### Why This Succeeds Where Others Haven't

**Designed for the actual workflow:** Built specifically for 3D print farm operations, not adapted from generic file management or project tools.

**Automation eliminates maintenance burden:** Metadata extraction means the system stays accurate without manual spreadsheet updates.

**Enables true delegation:** With recipe cards showing exact instructions (filaments, slots, files, thumbnails), assistants operate independently - removing the owner as bottleneck.

**Web-based accessibility:** Manage operations remotely. Make print decisions from anywhere without needing access to local file systems.

### The Ideal User Experience

**For Owner (Remote Management):**

1. **Find & Print:** Search for a product → See all available slice recipes → Download gcode → Send to assistant → Print
2. **Add New Models:** Upload model zip file → System extracts STL/3MF files and images → Organized automatically
3. **Add Slice Versions:** Upload `.gcode.3mf` → Metadata auto-extracted → Filaments auto-matched (or inline created) → Recipe ready

**For Assistant (Production Execution):**

1. **Browse Products:** Visual gallery with thumbnails
2. **Select Recipe:** Click product → See slice recipe card
3. **Execute Print:** Recipe card shows:
   - Filament requirements with AMS slot assignments
   - Print settings summary
   - Downloadable gcode file
   - Product thumbnail
4. **Print without questions:** All information needed is in the recipe - no owner dependency

**The Promise:** Upload once, print forever. Every slice becomes a permanent, reproducible recipe accessible to the entire operation.

### Strategic Initiatives

**Core Strategic Initiative: Scale Production Capacity**

PrintFarm Manager is the **enabler** for the primary strategic initiative: **increase printer uptime and production capacity** without adding operational overhead.

**How It Supports the Initiative:**

1. **Increase Printer Uptime**
   - **Problem:** Printers sit idle while owner searches for files, reslices, or answers assistant questions
   - **Solution:** Instant recipe access means printers can be loaded and printing in 5 minutes
   - **Impact:** Convert idle time to productive manufacturing time

2. **Enable Delegation**
   - **Problem:** Owner is bottleneck - assistants can't operate independently
   - **Solution:** Recipe cards provide complete instructions, removing owner dependency
   - **Impact:** Owner can focus on business growth instead of answering "which filament where?"

3. **Support Product Expansion**
   - **Problem:** Adding products increases operational chaos
   - **Solution:** Systematic recipe management scales linearly with product count
   - **Impact:** Can add 10x products without 10x operational overhead

4. **Reduce Lost Revenue**
   - **Problem:** Items don't get printed because process is too manual/chaotic
   - **Solution:** Frictionless reprinting means products stay in stock
   - **Impact:** Fewer missed sales, better inventory availability

**Opportunity Cost of NOT Building This:**

- **Lost time:** Hours weekly on redundant reslicing compounds over time
- **Fewer products:** Can't expand catalog without better operational systems
- **Inventory gaps:** Difficulty keeping items in stock loses revenue
- **Scaling ceiling:** Current approach fundamentally cannot support business growth
- **Competitive disadvantage:** Manual operations can't compete with systematic competitors

**Strategic ROI:**
This isn't just operational efficiency - it's the **prerequisite for scaling the business**. Without it, growth is blocked. With it, growth becomes systematically achievable.

- Automatic material cost calculations
- Reorder timing based on actual consumption
- Prevention of mid-print filament runout
- Full traceability from product → slice → filament → physical spool

**Other High-Value Phase 2 Features:**

- **Product Inventory/Stock Tracking:** Track product quantities, set reorder points, get alerts when inventory is low
- **Slice Version History:** Maintain unlimited versions with diff viewer to see settings changes over time
- **Reorder Alerts and Proactive Suggestions:** Dashboard showing what needs to be printed based on inventory levels
- **Auto-Pricing Calculator:** Calculate material costs and print time costs from metadata for pricing decisions
- **Designer Entity and Licensing:** Track designer attribution and commercial use permissions
- **Command Palette (Cmd+K):** Power user shortcuts for fast navigation
- **Bulk/Batch Upload:** Multi-file and folder uploads for efficiency

## Risks and Open Questions

### Key Risks

**No Critical Risks Identified**

The project is well-scoped with validated technical feasibility. Key assumptions have been tested or have high confidence levels. The main "risks" are actually unknowns that will be resolved through development and use:

**Technical Unknowns (Low Risk):**
- **Metadata parsing edge cases:** Bambu Lab format is confirmed to be JSON (example file reviewed). String parsing will be straightforward. Risk: Edge cases in different slicer versions may require handling.
- **R2 storage costs at scale:** Unlikely to be prohibitive based on transparent pricing. Migration path exists if needed.
- **Performance optimization:** May require iteration to hit 30-second target consistently, but architecture supports it.

**Business Unknowns (Deferred):**
- **Market validation:** SaaS potential unproven, but personal use validates core value regardless
- **Competitive landscape:** Unknown if similar solutions exist, but custom needs justify build-vs-buy
- **Monetization model:** Research needed, but not relevant to MVP success

**Adoption Risk Mitigation:**
- Pain points are severe enough to drive adoption
- System designed to be easier than current workflow
- Daily use will quickly reveal if value proposition holds

### Open Questions

**MVP Implementation Questions (To Be Resolved During Development):**

1. **Database Schema Finalization**
   - Status: Not finalized yet, but straightforward
   - Complexity: Low - entities and relationships are well-defined from brainstorming
   - Timeline: Design before Priority #1 implementation

2. **Authentication Approach**
   - Decision: **NO authentication for MVP**
   - Rationale: Single-user deployment, unnecessary complexity for initial version
   - Future: Authentication becomes Phase 3 feature if SaaS direction is pursued

3. **Metadata Extraction Implementation Details**
   - Status: Format confirmed (JSON file at `Metadata/project_settings.config`)
   - Example file stored at: `docs/bambu-lab-metadata-example.json`
   - Key fields identified:
     - `filament_colour`: Array of hex colors (e.g., `["#0086D6", "#000000"]`)
     - `filament_type`: Array of materials (e.g., `["PLA", "PLA"]`)
     - `filament_vendor`: Array of brands (e.g., `["Bambu Lab", "Bambu Lab"]`)
     - `filament_settings_id`: Filament profiles with details
     - `filament_self_index`: Array indicating AMS slot assignments (e.g., `["1", "2"]`)
     - `layer_height`, `nozzle_temperature`, print speeds, etc.
   - Complexity: Low - standard JSON parsing

4. **File Upload Size Limits**
   - Question: What are actual Cloudflare Workers limits for file uploads?
   - Research needed: Workers request size limits, streaming upload patterns
   - Mitigation: Client-side file size validation, chunked uploads if needed

5. **Thumbnail Extraction Sources**
   - Confirmed: Bambu files contain embedded thumbnails
   - Need to determine: Exact format and location of thumbnail data in .gcode.3mf structure
   - Likely: Base64 encoded image data in metadata or separate file in archive
