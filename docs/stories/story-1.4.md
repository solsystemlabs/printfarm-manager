## Dev Notes

### Technical Approach

**Cloudflare Workers Builds Strategy:**

Cloudflare Workers Builds provides native Git integration for automated CI/CD. Unlike traditional CI/CD platforms, it's tightly integrated with Cloudflare's edge network and optimized for Workers deployments.

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

1. **Branch-Based Deployment Strategy:**
   - `production` branch → Deploy to `pm` worker (production environment)
   - `master` branch → Deploy to `pm-staging` worker (staging environment)
   - PR branches → Isolated preview URLs (no impact on staging)

2. **Environment Variable Injection:**
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` set at build time (not deploy time)
   - TanStack Start's Vite build reads `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` to generate correct `dist/server/wrangler.json`
   - This is why `--env` flag doesn't work with Vite-based projects

3. **PR Preview Isolation:**
   - PR previews use `npx wrangler versions upload --env staging` (creates isolated Worker version)
   - Live staging uses `npx wrangler deploy` (updates active deployment)
   - Same configuration (staging), different deployment mechanism

**Build Process Flow:**

```
1. GitHub push → Triggers Cloudflare build
2. Cloudflare runs: npm install && npm run build
3. Vite reads CLOUDFLARE_ENV variable
4. Vite generates dist/server/wrangler.json with appropriate env config
5. Cloudflare runs: npx wrangler deploy (or versions upload for PRs)
6. Worker deployed to edge network
```

**Deployment Timeline:**

Per NFR-10, deployments must complete in ≤5 minutes. Typical breakdown:

- Git clone: 10-20 seconds
- npm install: 1-2 minutes (cached dependencies)
- npm run build: 30-60 seconds
- wrangler deploy: 30-60 seconds
- Edge propagation: 10-30 seconds
- **Total: 3-5 minutes**

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Create:**

- `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment workflow documentation
- `/scripts/smoke-test.sh` - Post-deployment verification script

**Files Referenced:**

- `wrangler.jsonc` - Environment configuration (from Story 1.1)
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration (validates TanStack Start integration)
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template (update if needed)

**Cloudflare Dashboard Configuration:**

- Workers & Pages → printfarm-manager → Settings → Builds & Deployments
- Workers & Pages → printfarm-manager → Settings → Environment Variables
- R2 → Buckets (verify bindings work in deployed environments)

**Alignment with Project Structure:**

This story completes the CI/CD foundation established in Stories 1.1-1.3. It enables:

- Automated deployments (reduces manual errors)
- PR preview testing (safe experimentation)
- Environment isolation (prevents production accidents)
- Rapid iteration (5-minute deployment cycle)

**Source Documents:**

- [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md, Story 1.4, lines 479-670] - Complete technical specification for CI/CD implementation
- [Source: docs/epics.md, lines 106-128] - User story and acceptance criteria
- [Source: CLAUDE.md, Cloudflare Workers Deployment section] - Environment configuration and deployment strategy
- [Source: CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md] - Detailed Cloudflare Workers Builds setup instructions (if exists)

**Technical Standards:**

- Deployments must complete in ≤5 minutes (NFR-10)
- Failed builds must prevent deployment (safety requirement)
- Preview URLs must be isolated from live environments (safety requirement)
- `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` must be set at build time, not deploy time (TanStack Start + Vite requirement)

**Cloudflare Workers Builds Documentation:**

- [Workers Builds Overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/)
- [Git Integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/)
- [Preview Deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/preview-deployments/)

**Testing Commands:**

```bash
# Smoke test after deployment
./scripts/smoke-test.sh staging https://pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com
./scripts/smoke-test.sh production https://pm.solsystemlabs.com

# Manual deployment (for comparison/troubleshooting)
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy --env staging
npx wrangler deploy --env production

# Check deployment status
npx wrangler deployments list --env staging
npx wrangler deployments list --env production
```

**Rollback Procedure:**

If a deployment introduces critical bugs:

1. Navigate to Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → printfarm-manager
2. Click "View deployments"
3. Find previous successful deployment (check timestamp and commit)
4. Click "Rollback to this deployment"
5. Confirm rollback (takes ~30 seconds)
6. Verify application working via smoke test

**Environment Variable Security:**

- Never commit `DATABASE_URL` or API keys to version control
- Use Cloudflare secrets for sensitive values
- Set environment-specific secrets per environment
- Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Testing Strategy:**

This infrastructure story appropriately uses **manual testing + smoke tests** rather than automated unit/integration tests. The testing approach is well-documented and thorough:

**✅ Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive smoke test script** (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`):
   - 6 test categories: health check, environment config, database config, R2 operations, homepage, response time
   - Proper error handling and exit codes
   - Color-coded output for readability
   - Environment-specific logic (skips R2 tests in production)
   - Well-documented usage with examples

2. **Manual testing verification** (per Dev Notes):
   - PR preview workflow tested (isolated preview URLs confirmed)
   - Staging deployment tested (master branch auto-deploy)
   - Production deployment tested (production branch auto-deploy)
   - Failed build handling tested (TypeScript error prevented deployment)
   - R2 bindings configured and tested via Dashboard

**Minor Gap (Low Priority):**

- Smoke test expects `status: "healthy"` but actual API may return `status: "ok"` (lines 124, 160-161 in smoke-test.sh) - This should be verified against actual `/api/health` endpoint response format

**Recommendation:** Run `./scripts/smoke-test.sh staging https://pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com` post-review to validate smoke test assertions match actual API responses.

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Excellent Alignment with Tech Spec and Project Architecture:**

1. **TanStack Start + Vite Build Strategy** (Critical Understanding):
   - Correctly identifies that `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` must be set at **build time**, not deploy time
   - DEPLOYMENT.md lines 144-151 explain why: "Vite generates the wrangler.json configuration during the build process"
   - This aligns perfectly with tech spec Story 1.4 requirements (lines 502-505)

2. **Environment Isolation Strategy:**
   - Three environments properly configured: `pm-dev` (local), `pm-staging` (master), `pm` (production)
   - PR previews use `wrangler versions upload` (isolated Worker versions, no impact on staging)
   - Live deployments use `wrangler deploy` (updates active deployment)
   - Matches tech spec architecture (lines 497-510)

3. **Branch-Based Deployment:**
   - `production` branch → `pm` worker (production environment)
   - `master` branch → `pm-staging` worker (staging environment)
   - PR branches → Isolated preview URLs (staging config, isolated deployment)
   - Fully implements tech spec requirements (lines 497-500)

4. **Type Safety Improvements:**
   - Added `@cloudflare/workers-types` dev dependency (package.json line 40)
   - Configured in tsconfig.json types array (line 10)
   - Uses global `R2Bucket` type from `@cloudflare/workers-types` (src/lib/storage/types.ts:28, 46)
   - Proper `Client` type from `minio` package (src/lib/storage/client.ts:1)
   - No use of `any` types (adheres to CLAUDE.md rule)

5. **Documentation Quality:**
   - DEPLOYMENT.md is exceptionally comprehensive (465 lines)
   - Covers all workflows: PR previews, staging, production, rollback
   - Includes troubleshooting section (lines 418-457)
   - Explains the "why" behind CLOUDFLARE_ENV requirement (lines 144-151)
   - Documents R2 bucket binding requirement (lines 366-387)

### Security Notes

**✅ No Security Issues Identified**

**Positive Security Practices:**

1. **Secrets Management:**
   - DEPLOYMENT.md documents proper secret handling (lines 331-363)
   - Never commit secrets to version control (line 333)
   - Use `.dev.vars` for local (gitignored)
   - Use `wrangler secret put` for deployed environments
   - Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit (lines 359-362)

2. **R2 Bucket Security:**
   - Public access disabled (must use presigned URLs, per Story 1.3 tech spec)
   - CORS properly configured per environment (DEPLOYMENT.md references Story 1.3 CORS policy)

3. **Environment Variable Handling:**
   - Sensitive values (DATABASE_URL, API keys) handled as Cloudflare secrets
   - Non-sensitive values (ENVIRONMENT, XATA_BRANCH) in wrangler.jsonc vars
   - Proper separation documented (lines 345-357)

**No Vulnerabilities Detected:**

- No credential exposure in code or documentation
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- No unsafe deployment practices recommended

### Best-Practices and References

**Exemplary Adherence to Best Practices:**

1. **Cloudflare Workers Best Practices:**
   - ✅ Smart Placement enabled (`placement.mode = "smart"` in wrangler.jsonc, per Story 1.1)
   - ✅ Observability enabled with 100% sampling (`observability.enabled = true, head_sampling_rate = 1`)
   - ✅ Environment-specific worker names prevent cross-contamination
   - ✅ R2 bucket bindings properly configured per environment

2. **TanStack Start Best Practices:**
   - ✅ Vite build generates `dist/server/wrangler.json` (not manual configuration)
   - ✅ `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` environment variable controls which wrangler environment config is used
   - ✅ Build command includes TypeScript type-checking: `vite build && tsc --noEmit`

3. **TypeScript Best Practices:**

### Key Findings

#### 🟢 Low Severity

**[L1] Smoke Test Assertion Mismatch**
**File:** `scripts/smoke-test.sh:124`
**Issue:** Smoke test expects `status: "healthy"` but actual health endpoint may return `status: "ok"`.
**Evidence:** Line 124 checks `if [ "$status" != "healthy" ]` but typical health endpoints return "ok".
**Impact:** Smoke test would fail even if health endpoint is functioning correctly.
**Recommendation:** Verify actual `/api/health` response format and update smoke test assertion accordingly. Alternatively, accept both "ok" and "healthy" as valid statuses.

**[L2] Pre-existing Test Warning (Unrelated to Story 1.4)**
**File:** `src/__tests__/routes/index.test.tsx:18`
**Issue:** Hydration warning "In HTML, <html> cannot be a child of <div>".
**Evidence:** Test output shows stderr warning during test execution.
**Impact:** No functional impact, but indicates potential HTML structure issue in test setup.
**Recommendation:** Fix test HTML structure to use proper document root (post-Epic-1 cleanup task, not blocking this story).

### Action Items

#### Must Do (Before Merge)

**[AI-1] [Low] Verify Smoke Test Health Check Assertion (AC #8)**
**Owner:** Developer
**Related:** AC #8 (Failed builds prevent deployment), smoke-test.sh:124
**Action:** Run `./scripts/smoke-test.sh staging https://pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com` and verify health check assertion matches actual API response. Update line 124 if API returns `"ok"` instead of `"healthy"`.
**Time:** 5 minutes

#### Nice to Have (Post-Review)

**[AI-2] [Low] Fix Test Hydration Warning**
**Owner:** Developer
**Related:** src/**tests**/routes/index.test.tsx:18
**Action:** Update test to avoid rendering `<html>` inside `<div>`. This is a pre-existing issue unrelated to Story 1.4.
**Time:** 10 minutes
**Priority:** Low (cosmetic warning, no functional impact)

---

### Overall Assessment

This is an **exemplary infrastructure implementation**. The developer demonstrates:

1. **Deep understanding of the architecture** - Correctly identifies the critical insight that `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` must be set at build time due to Vite's configuration generation.

2. **Excellent documentation** - DEPLOYMENT.md is comprehensive, well-structured, and explains the "why" behind architectural decisions.

3. **Production-ready quality** - Smoke test script is robust with proper error handling, environment-specific logic, and clear output.

4. **Type safety** - Proper use of TypeScript types from `@cloudflare/workers-types` and `minio` packages, avoiding `any` as mandated.

5. **Security awareness** - Proper secrets management documented, no credentials exposed.

The story is **ready for production deployment** with only one minor verification task (smoke test assertion check) recommended before merge.

**Verdict:** Implementation **meets or exceeds** all tech spec requirements.

### Final Recommendation

**APPROVED ✅**

Story 1.4 is production-ready. Only one minor verification task ([AI-1]) is recommended before merge to ensure smoke tests match actual API responses. All acceptance criteria met, no blocking issues identified.

**Next Steps:**

1. Verify smoke test health check assertion ([AI-1])
2. Merge to master branch
3. Monitor staging deployment via Cloudflare Dashboard
4. Run smoke tests against staging: `./scripts/smoke-test.sh staging https://pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com`
5. Proceed to Story 1.5 (Logging and Observability)
