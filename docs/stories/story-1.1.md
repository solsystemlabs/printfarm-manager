# Story 1.1: Configure Cloudflare Workers Environments

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer,
I want three distinct Cloudflare Workers environments configured in wrangler.jsonc,
so that I can develop locally, test in staging, and deploy to production safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `wrangler.jsonc` defines three environments: development (pm-dev), staging (pm-staging), production (pm)
2. Each environment has unique worker name to prevent conflicts
3. Environment-specific variables configured: `ENVIRONMENT` = "development"/"staging"/"production"
4. Smart Placement enabled in wrangler.jsonc (`placement: { mode: "smart" }`)
5. Observability configured with 100% head sampling rate
6. Local development runs with `npm run dev` using pm-dev configuration
7. Documentation updated with environment configuration details

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create/update wrangler.jsonc with environment configurations (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [x] Define base configuration for pm-dev (development)
  - [x] Add env.staging block for pm-staging worker
  - [x] Add env.production block for pm worker
  - [x] Set ENVIRONMENT variable for each environment
  - [x] Configure custom domain routes for staging/production
- [x] Enable Smart Placement and Observability (AC: #4, #5)
  - [x] Add `placement: { mode: "smart" }` to base config
  - [x] Add `observability: { enabled: true, head_sampling_rate: 1 }` to base config
- [x] Verify local development configuration (AC: #6)
  - [x] Run `npm run dev` and verify pm-dev worker name in output
  - [x] Test that ENVIRONMENT variable is accessible via getContext
- [x] Test staging/production configurations (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [x] Run `npx wrangler deploy --env staging --dry-run`
  - [x] Run `npx wrangler deploy --env production --dry-run`
  - [x] Verify correct worker names and variables in dry-run output
- [x] Update documentation (AC: #7)
  - [x] Add environment configuration details to CLAUDE.md or separate doc
  - [x] Document wrangler.jsonc structure and purpose of each environment

### Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][Medium] Fix hydration warning in route test - Investigate and resolve HTML structure issue in `src/__tests__/routes/index.test.tsx:18` causing hydration mismatch (pre-existing, unrelated to Story 1.1)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Approach

**Single wrangler.jsonc with Environment Blocks:**

- Base configuration serves local development (pm-dev)
- `env.staging` and `env.production` blocks override base settings
- Each environment gets unique worker name and ENVIRONMENT variable
- Aligns with Cloudflare Workers best practices for multi-environment setup

**Key Configuration Points:**

- Smart Placement optimizes worker execution location based on subrequest patterns
- 100% head sampling (observability) enables comprehensive request tracing in Cloudflare logs
- Custom domain routes ensure staging and production are accessible at their respective URLs

**Testing Strategy:**

- Local: `npm run dev` should show pm-dev worker
- Dry-run deployments verify configuration without actual deployment
- Real deployments tested in Story 1.4 (CI/CD setup)

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `/wrangler.jsonc` - Primary configuration file (should already exist from TanStack Start template)
- `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` or add section to existing docs - Environment setup documentation

**Alignment with Existing Structure:**

- TanStack Start generates `dist/server/wrangler.json` during build (via Vite)
- Our `wrangler.jsonc` serves as source configuration
- `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` environment variable (set during CI/CD) determines which env config is used

### References

**Source Documents:**

- [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md, lines 63-165] - Complete technical specification for Story 1.1
- [Source: docs/epics.md, lines 37-57] - User story and acceptance criteria
- [Source: CLAUDE.md, Cloudflare Workers Deployment section] - Environment configuration guidance and wrangler.jsonc structure

**Technical Standards:**

- Use JSONC format (JSON with comments) for wrangler.jsonc
- Follow TanStack Start conventions for Worker configuration
- Custom domains already configured: pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com, pm.solsystemlabs.com

**Example Configuration Structure (from tech-spec):**

```jsonc
{
  "name": "pm-dev",
  "main": "dist/server/index.mjs",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-01-15",
  "vars": {
    "ENVIRONMENT": "development",
  },
  "placement": {
    "mode": "smart",
  },
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true,
    "head_sampling_rate": 1,
  },
  "env": {
    "staging": {
      "name": "pm-staging",
      "vars": {
        "ENVIRONMENT": "staging",
      },
      "routes": [
        {
          "pattern": "pm-staging.solsystemlabs.com",
          "custom_domain": true,
        },
      ],
    },
    "production": {
      "name": "pm",
      "vars": {
        "ENVIRONMENT": "production",
      },
      "routes": [
        {
          "pattern": "pm.solsystemlabs.com",
          "custom_domain": true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

**Testing Commands:**

```bash
# Test local dev environment
npm run dev
# Verify: Worker starts with pm-dev name

# Test staging deployment (dry-run)
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy --env staging --dry-run
# Verify: Shows pm-staging worker name

# Test production deployment (dry-run)
npx wrangler deploy --env production --dry-run
# Verify: Shows pm worker name
```

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Taylor
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story 1.1 successfully implements the core wrangler.jsonc environment configuration with proper separation of development, staging, and production environments. The implementation aligns well with the technical specification and includes Smart Placement and Observability features. As this is purely infrastructure configuration (no application code), automated test coverage is not applicable. Manual verification was appropriately performed per the tech spec.

### Key Findings

#### Medium Severity

- **[M1] Hydration Warning in Test Output** - Test console shows "In HTML, <html> cannot be a child of <div>" hydration error. While tests pass, this indicates a potential structural issue that could cause runtime problems. This is unrelated to Story 1.1 but should be addressed. (File: `src/__tests__/routes/index.test.tsx:18`)

#### Low Severity

- **[L1] Incomplete File List Documentation** - File List in Dev Agent Record only lists 3 files, but ESLint config changes suggest more investigation occurred. Consider documenting viewed/analyzed files separately from modified files for future reference. (File: `docs/stories/story-1.1.md:170-174`)

**Overall Coverage: 7/7 (100%)** - All acceptance criteria functionally met, but quality concerns remain

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Testing Approach for Infrastructure Configuration:**

This story implements pure infrastructure configuration (wrangler.jsonc) with no application code, so automated unit/integration tests are not applicable. The tech spec (lines 150-164) prescribes manual verification via:

- ✅ `npm run dev` - Verified pm-dev worker starts
- ✅ `npm run build` - Verified build succeeds and generates correct artifacts
- ✅ Dry-run deployments - Verified staging/production configurations (per completion notes)

This testing approach is appropriate and sufficient for infrastructure configuration stories.

**Unrelated Test Issue Found:**

- Hydration warning in existing route test (`src/__tests__/routes/index.test.tsx:18`) - Pre-existing issue, not introduced by this story

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Aligned with Tech Spec:**

- Single wrangler.jsonc with environment blocks matches Epic 1 Story 1.1 specification exactly (lines 76-139 of tech-spec-epic-1.md)
- Environment variable strategy follows documented pattern
- Smart Placement and Observability settings match requirements

✅ **Follows TanStack Start Conventions:**

- Uses TanStack Start's default configuration structure
- Leverages Vite build integration correctly
- Maintains compatibility with Cloudflare Workers runtime

⚠️ **Minor Concerns:**

- No validation that `@tanstack/react-start/server-entry` correctly reads environment config from generated wrangler.json
- Reliance on CLOUDFLARE_ENV environment variable during build is documented but not enforced or validated

### Security Notes

✅ **No Security Issues Identified:**

- No secrets in wrangler.jsonc (correctly uses vars for non-sensitive values only)
- Environment-specific sensitive values documented as needing Cloudflare secrets (DATABASE_URL)
- CORS and access control deferred to appropriate stories (Story 1.3 for R2)

**Best Practice Compliance:**

- ✅ Observability enabled for security monitoring
- ✅ Environment isolation properly configured
- ✅ No credentials leaked in configuration files

### Best-Practices and References

**Framework/Tool References:**

1. **Cloudflare Workers Configuration** - [wrangler.jsonc follows official schema](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/)
   - ✅ Uses recommended environment-based configuration pattern
   - ✅ Smart Placement is a [Cloudflare best practice](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) for latency optimization

2. **TanStack Start Deployment** - [Cloudflare Workers adapter](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/deployment/cloudflare)
   - ✅ Configuration aligns with TanStack Start's Cloudflare integration requirements
   - ⚠️ CLOUDFLARE_ENV pattern is project-specific (not documented in TanStack official docs)

3. **ESLint v9 (Flat Config)** - [Migration guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)
   - ✅ Correctly implements flat config pattern
   - ✅ Ignores patterns properly structured

4. **Testing Best Practices** - [Vitest + React Testing Library](https://vitest.dev/guide/)
   - ⚠️ Hydration warning suggests missing `@testing-library/react` SSR setup
   - Recommended: Use `renderToString` for SSR testing or configure JSDOM properly
